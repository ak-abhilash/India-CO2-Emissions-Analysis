### Introduction

The project focuses on examining the relationship between CO2 emissions and India's economic growth, offering a nuanced perspective on how these factors interplay over a 25-year period. By combining CO2 emissions, GDP data, and a range of statistical methods, this project aims to contribute valuable insights into the environmental implications of economic development.

### Datasets

The project utilizes the following datasets:

1. **CO2 Emissions Data:** This dataset spans from 1996 to 2020, offering annual CO2 emissions data for India. The emissions data provides a comprehensive view of India's contribution to global carbon emissions over this period.

2. **GDP Data:** Economic growth analysis is enriched with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data covering the same timeframe. By correlating GDP and CO2 emissions, the project uncovers insights into the economic-environment relationship.

3. **Top Countries' CO2 Emission Data:** Comparative analysis is enriched by including CO2 emissions data for the top emitting countries. This provides a global context for India's emissions and illustrates its standing on the world stage.

4. **Population Data:** Incorporating population data for India allows for calculations of per capita emissions, enhancing the understanding of individual contributions to the country's emissions profile.

### Analysis and Visualizations

The project encompasses a series of analyses and visualizations:

1. **Correlation Analysis:** Investigating the correlation between CO2 emissions and GDP to understand the relationship between economic growth and environmental impact.

2. **Regression Analysis:** Employing regression techniques to model the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth, offering predictive insights.

3. **Per Capita Emission Analysis:** Exploring per capita CO2 emissions to understand the individual contribution to the emissions profile.

4. **Emission Intensity:** Analyzing the CO2 emission intensity concerning economic output, portraying efficiency in emissions.

5. **International Comparison:** Comparing India's CO2 emissions with those of the top 10 emitting countries to contextualize its global standing.

6. **Annual Growth Rate:** Calculating and visualizing the annual growth rate of CO2 emissions, revealing trends and fluctuations.
